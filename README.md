### Update: Mar 12, 2015
Version 0.2 is out and gone are the days of multiple windows!!!

TTLogger now opens only one window and allows you to enter your log for a specific time by selecting it from a select on top of the window. Give it a try!!!

# How it works
The text entered is saved inside the same folder where TTLogger resides. The logged information will be saved as a simple text file.

Inside each file, each entry will start with the time of day the window was initially opened.
